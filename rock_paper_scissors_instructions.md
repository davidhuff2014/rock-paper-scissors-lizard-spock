## Version 1 - Ruby -> JavaScript

For the initial version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, take our existing Ruby code and 
Jasmine specs and implement RPS in JavaScript. Some gotchas to watch out for:

* There's no concept of **symbols** in JavaScript (everything is a string)
* **Blocks, methods and classes** are replaced with the :pill: [function keyword](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_functions.md).
* We define methods outside of the 'class' using the :pill: [prototype](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_functions.md#function-to-define-methods).
* There are **no constants, or private methods** in JavaScript - so instead we should use :pill: [helpful conventions](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_conventions.md).

## Version 2 - Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

![Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/rpsls.jpg)

For the next iteration, add two new options into the mix: **Lizard** and **Spock**. You can see in the above diagram how these new choices fare against existing matchups, for more info see:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock

Write new Jasmine specs for these new choices. 
Try and avoid a bunch of long, complicated `if` statements in your implementation. 
Knowledge of :pill: [arrays in JavaScript]
(https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/js_arrays.md) might come in handy.

### Version 2.5 - Victory messages

 Write a new method (with specs) in your Game class, that returns a string with 
 the winning player's name, the winning player's pick, the losing player's name and pick, 
 joined with an appropriate verb. E.g.

> **Alex's rock crushes Tony's scissors**

## Version 3 - Web interface

![RPS interface](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/raw/master/images/rps_interface.png)

Build a simple web interface using HTML and CSS for your Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Using :pill: [jQuery event handlers](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/jquery_events.md) to select the player choice when one of the buttons on the page are clicked. Use [data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes) to tie a particular button to a particular choice.

For the initial version, the computer opponent can always choose the same thing - e.g. always 
picks rock.

Once the player has picked something, the result ("Alex's rock crushes Tony's scissors") should be appended as a HTML snippet to the bottom of the page. Additionally, try using jQuery animations or [CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions) to animate the message appearing.

### Version 3.5 - Randomness and clearing messages

There are a couple of small improvements we can make. First, we can make the game more 
interesting by having the computer pick their choice at random. 
To implement this JavaScript's `Math.random()` method will come in handy.

Additionally, the messages will continue to build up infinitely. 
Enhance the app so that only the results from the most recent 5 games are displayed. 
Ideally, old messages should be removed from the DOM (HTML document) 
as well as being visually hidden.

## Version 4 - Deploy to Heroku

Finally, let's push the application to Heroku. 
Until now we've been dealing with static HTML/CSS/JS files, 
but to run this on Heroku's platform, we'll need a very simple server to serve the site. 
We'll use a minimal Sinatra app to make this deployable.

Our HTML file (e.g. `index.html`) should be given a `.erb` extension and moved 
to the views directory (e.g. `views/index.erb`). 
Our CSS and JS files should be moved into the `public` directory.

We'll need a Gemfile to load in Sinatra:

~~~ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'sinatra'
~~~

A very simple Sinatra app.rb:

~~~ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  erb :index
end
~~~

And finally a `config.ru` -

~~~ruby
require_relative './app'

Sinatra::Application.run!
~~~

Finally we can create our Heroku app and deploy it:

~~~
heroku create myrpsapp
git push heroku master
~~~
